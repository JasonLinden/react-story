import React from 'react'

export default () => (
  <div>
    <p>
      This is a React Story! A simple component for <strong>quickly and easily showcasing React components</strong>. In this case, this React Story is showcasing React Story itself! Inception!
    </p>
    <p>
      React Story can be used with <strong>any build system</strong>, any react app, or any other components. It comes with a <strong> built-in, but optional router </strong> and is even <strong>hyper-responsive (try resizing your browser!)</strong>. It makes no assumptions, and by design, is as simple as possible. But, in the case you want to customize, be happy that every single internal component can be overridden and decorated to your hearts desire.
    </p>
  </div>
